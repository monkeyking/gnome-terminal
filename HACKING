Mailing list
===

Discussion about gnome-terminal should happen on desktop-devel-list@gnome.org,
gnome-list@gnome.org, or usability@gnome.org, depending on what sort of
discussion it is. Reporting a bug on http://bugzilla.gnome.org is equally fine.

Remember that the terminal emulation is provided by the VTE widget, maintained
as the 'vte' module on the GNOME CVS. The gnome-terminal product in bugzilla
only covers the menubar, toolbar, and command line options, essentially. VTE,
in turn, is responsible for the actual terminal display.

Coding Style
===

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions (e.g. lining up
   function arguments). Basically the same as GTK+

Making a release
===

To make a release of gnome-terminal, check out a fresh copy from CVS, increment
the version number in configure.in, edit ChangeLog accordingly and update the
NEWS file, including translations.

See <http://live.gnome.org/MaintainersCorner/Releasing> for delails.
