Mailing list
===

Discussion of gnome-terminal should go to
desktop-devel-list@gnome.org, gnome-list@gnome.org, or
usability@gnome.org, depending on what sort of discussion it is. Or
just file a bug report in http://bugzilla.gnome.org

Remember that terminal emulation behavior is provided by the VTE
widget.  The gnome-terminal product in bugzilla only covers the
menubar, toolbar, and command line options, essentially. Everything
about the actual terminal display is VTE.

Coding Style
===

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions (e.g. lining up
   function arguments). Basically the same as GTK+

Making a release
===

To make a release of gnome-terminal, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from CVS

 - increment the version number in configure.in

 - update the file NEWS based on the ChangeLog

 - add a ChangeLog entry containing the version number 
   you're releasing ("Released 0.3" or something)
   so people can see which changes were before and after
   a given release.

 - "make distcheck" (DO NOT just "make dist" - pass the check!)

 - if make distcheck fails, fix it.

 - once distcheck succeeds, "cvs commit"

 - if someone else made changes and the commit fails, 
   you have to "cvs up" and run "make distcheck" again

 - once the commit succeeds, "cvs tag GNOME_TERMINAL_X_Y_Z" where 
   X_Y_Z map to version X.Y.Z

 - scp the tarball to master.gnome.org

 - run install-module on master.gnome.org to install the tarball 
   on the ftp site.
